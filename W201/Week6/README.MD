Discussion Questions:
* Pick a contemporary business or trade magazine (e.g., Business Week, Harvard Business Review, Wall Street Journal, The Economist, etc.). Find an article that addresses an important question, but falls short. In other words, find an article that poorly frames or articulates an important question.
* Explain why the question is poorly framed.
  * Consider why the framers made the mistakes they did.
  * How would you reframe the question as a research question for better results?
  * Explain why that reframe would enable better, more actionable research outcomes.
  * Reframe the question clearly and show the before-and-after versions of the question.
* Hints: 
  * Think about the difference between a research question and how people usually ask questions when they are lazy about research design (Use Creswell as your guide).
  * You may have sub-questions, but a research question is typically a single sentence. You may include additional sentences to provide context, but you should focus on how to craft a single, clear research question sentence.  
  * Research is an iterative process. You will rarely formulate the research question correctly the first time. Overall, you will get more insight out of a research question that is almost right than one that is terrible. It is valuable to identify the “right” research question, but it is also valuable to find smart people who missed the mark.
* Be prepared to share and discuss your thoughts in class. Use the discussion section of your portfolio to write your notes.
