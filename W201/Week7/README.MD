Discussion Questions:

* Find an article that makes a meaningful fallacy of argumentation. Describe the error of logic and present your argument for why it is fallacious. Don’t worry if you can’t precisely label the fallacy. Rather than fix it, tell us why you think the author made the suspect argument and describe why the fallacy is sticky and difficult to remedy. Think of answers to the following questions:
  * What is the fallacy?
  * Why is the fallacy so sticky?
  * Why is the fallacy difficult to fix?
  * In your experience, how prevalent is the fallacy in business decision making? Share an example.
  * How impactful is the fallacy on a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high)? Why?
* Extra hint: Don’t look at too many articles. Almost every article in an opinion (or news) section of a major publication will contain some fallacious reasoning.
* Be prepared to share and discuss your thoughts in class. Use the discussion section of your portfolio to write your notes.
