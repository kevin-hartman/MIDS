Additional video:
* Below you can find a short youtube video that will supplement my overview at the beginning of class. You must be signed into your bmail account to view the video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQJL6-aYAmw&feature=youtu.be
* Mike mentions that the Kahneman text discusses the uses and abuses of anchors on page 163. It’s page 126, not page 163. 

Additional Async Notes
* I encourage you to read the intro to Kahneman (2011) Thinking, Fast and Slow to give the chapters additional context. Below are some key quotes.
  * One of the aims of the book is to “improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves by providing a richer and more precise language to discuss them. In at least some cases, an accurate diagnosis may suggest an intervention to limit the damage that bad judgment and choices often cause” (p.4)
  * “A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome.” (p.9)
  * Origin of the title. “The spontaneous search for an intuitive solution sometimes fails—neither an expert solution nor a heuristic answer comes to mind. In such cases we often find ourselves switching to a slower, more deliberate and effortful form of thinking. This is the slow thinking of the title. Fast thinking includes both variants of intuitive thought—the expert and the heuristic—as well as the entirely automatic mental activities of perception and memory, the operations that enable you to know there is a lamp on your desk or retrieve the name of the capital of Russia.” (p. 13)
* Daniel Kahneman on NPR, Hidden Brain (link to audio). This interview is awesome. It reinforces many of the ideas covered in the book. 
  * [Daniel Kahneman On Misery, Memory, And Our Understanding Of The Mind March 12, 2018](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/12/592986190/daniel-kahneman-on-misery-memory-and-our-understanding-of-the-mind)
* If you want more on many of the ideas presented in the Kahneman reading, the optional Heuer readings compliments the Kahneman text well.
* Remember all optional readings are optional. If you decide to skim the optional readings, I recommend you skip the Davenport readings from Judgment Calls: Twelve Stories of Big Decisions and the Teams That Got Them Right. If you want to peek at them, the [following link](https://books.google.com/books?id=H-wtglBZ5wIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Judgment+calls+:+12+stories+of+big+decisions+and+the+teams+that+got+them+right&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwis1t3K0v7YAhVG5mMKHevMDgkQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q&f=false) provides most of the chapters. The main takeaways are 
  * How do you minimize the cost of making bad decisions?
    * “The WGB story also illustrates a key aspect of decision process design: to delay decision making until more information is available, or to lower the cost of changing your mind if you decide your initial decision was suboptimal. This is, in effect, a way to minimize the cost of poor organizational judgment.” (ch. 2) 
  * Should you and how should you reinvent a company?
    * “Was it time to reinvent this historically successful company? What was the right way to bring together—or create mutual reinforcing advantage among—Internet, publishing, and broadcasting businesses? How should they do that?” (ch. 10)
* [This link](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cognitive-bias-infographic.html) may be helpful to visualize many of the cognitive biases. Don’t worry about knowing all of them. Topline take away--our brain takes shortcuts that are often inaccurate. 

Discussion Questions:
* Prepare a scene that describes bias in action. Think of an organization where decision bias is visible and contributes significantly to what people do or where decision bias affects an outcome. You may use your Week 2 discussion question as a starting point or you can use a new client that interests you. Be prepared to explain the story and demonstrate the bias. Be sure to:
  * Give the scene a substantive title.
  * Identify the most important decision makers (not necessarily a boss or CEO). Describe the scene or organizational context in which they are making the decision (e.g. resources, stressors, constraints, etc.).
  * Identify and specify the bias present in the situation. Think of the Kahneman text. You may also describe a new kind of bias you see.
  * Demonstrate the bias in action (provide an illustrative example).
  * Imagine yourself in a professional context giving advice or designing products or services. Propose a means to compensate for or counteract the bias.
* Try to empathize to the decision-maker what it would be like to resist or alleviate the bias. What are the benefits of an attempt to counteract this bias? Hint: To claim you will fully prevent the bias may be unrealistic; instead, think about how to “move toward the truth.”
* Be prepared to share and discuss your thoughts in class. Use the discussion section of your portfolio to write your notes.
