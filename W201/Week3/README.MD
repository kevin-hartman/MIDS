Discussion Questions:
* The async material for week 3 focuses on making decisions in high stress environments. In particular, the readings focus on the Cuban Missile Crisis. Many of you have or will make decisions in similar high stress, high stakes environments. To make matters worse, many of these important decisions have significant time constraints.
* The readings also emphasize that if you want to influence the decision making process, it is useful to have a framework to think about how decisions are made within organizations. It's important to know how orgs operate and how things like organizational culture and standard operating procedures influence high-level decisions.
* Below are some questions to guide you through the material.
  * What is analysis paralysis? Can you think of a situation where you would add or take out data to make a decision in the face of analysis paralysis?
  * Problem definition is political
    * “Problem arises in society; problem is recognized by powerful elites or interest groups; an organization is created, exploiting its superior capacities and efficiency, to address the problem” (Allison and Zelikow 1999, p149).
    * -What is problem definition and how does it relate to question formation? How does problem definition matter?
	* This is a fantastic text that discussion problem definition. It’s very similar to asking the right question.
	* [A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis: The Eightfold Path to More Effective Problem Solving By Eugene Bardach, Eric M. Patashnik](./A_Practical_Guide_for_Policy_Analysis-_Bardoch_E.pdf)
  * What is the McNamara Fallacy? Do you observe the fallacy in your industry? 
  * That’s just how we do it.
    * “Observers of organizational output are familiar with persistence in established patterns, details of operations that follow from standard operating procedures, and oddities that become normal to specific cultures.” (Allison and Zelikow 1999, p. 217)
	* -How are decisions made in your organization? How do standard operating procedures influence what you do? Do you find them helpful or are they a hindrance?
  * How might frameworks about how decisions are made in organizations be useful to data scientists?
  
* Models
  * Rational Actor Model
  * Organizational Process Model (Standard Operating Procedures)
  * Beurocratic Politics Model
  
* Key takeaways
  * Data doesn't always favor the rational choice model
  * More data isn't always more better
  * Need to understand the climate and context around the decision making process
    * There will always be a political element
    * It will be loaded with emotion
    * There will be asymmetric information
