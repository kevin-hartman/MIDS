Additional takeaways:
* The big takeaway from this week is that if we pay explicit attention to narrative structure we can improve how we communicate our findings. If we explicitly think about narrative structure we can improve how we talk to both data-mind and data skeptic people. Numbers resonate with some people, but everyone can remember a story.
* Two additional takeaways: 
  * 1) you don’t need (many) words on your slides to say a lot; 
  * 2) you can still tell a convincing story without relying on the numbers/stats as a crutch.  
* We won't have time to chat much about the async material as a group; however, you will use the Invisible Ink structure in your presentations and you can expect to talk about Invisible Ink and narrative structure in the Q & A.

* Here are some questions to help guide you through the async material:

* 1) Weber's narrative structure from async video:
  * What's the question?
  * Where did it come from?
  * What's the answer?
  * How do I know that?
  * So what?
* Do you use the narrative structure Weber describes?
* How much effort/time do you spend on the various components of this narrative structure?
* How much effort do you spend on the "so what?" In other words, how much do you convince the audience that they too should care?
* How much effort do you spend on "how do I know that?" In other words, do you describe how you know the data tells us what you purport it tells us?

* 2) What does it mean to know your audience? Describe how you gauge your audience? How varied are you audiences? What are some challenges you encounter and how do you overcome them?

* 3a) Invisible Ink
  * What’s the role of invisible ink in your work? In other words, how often do you think about the structure of your story, or the writing below the surface?
  * 3b) What role does storytelling have when you present findings? Think about your argument and the story/narrative that helps communicate your argument/plot. Do you think explicitly about the narrative? If so, describe how you use narrative structure. If not, discuss how you could integrate narrative structure when you present your findings.
