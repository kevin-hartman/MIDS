Additional takeaways:
* Below are some questions to help you digest the material
  * What is persuasion? What’s the difference between informing and persuading?
  * Identify a difficult persuasion challenge you’ve faced in recent history from business or any other part of your life. What was the persuasion challenge? Why was it so difficult? What would you have done differently or what tools do you wish you had (not limited to data) that would have made the persuasion more effective?
  * What ethical considerations should we keep in mind when we persuade?
    * When does persuasion become manipulation?
  * Everybody has a different personality, and not everyone has a “persuasive personality.” How does one develop the skills to be persuasive? Specifically, how do data scientists become more persuasive?
