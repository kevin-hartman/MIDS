Additional Async Notes
* Some questions to guide you if you read/skim the optional week 5 reading. (Or some questions to think about even if you don’t read the optional text.)
* [Engineering and Public Policy Committee on Science. On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research. National Academies Press, 2009.](./12192.pdf)
* Reading is useful for new data scientists but also is a good reality check for more seasoned people. What does it mean to conduct responsible or ethical research? Ask yourself, how much does this mirror my experience or what I do?
  * Q: How might you respond to a concern/report about irresponsible behaviors?
  * Q: What level of (dis)aggregation should data be made available? What is the standard of replicability in your industry? Does it depend on the deliverable?
  * Q: How do you deal with outlier or anomalies? Are there ethical concerns if a company shields itself from scrutiny behind veil of proprietary software, etc? e.g. fracking? Or Google algorithm?
  * Q: How do you deal with the discovery of errors in your analysis or data? Do you only report errors if they change the results? Would you report them if they change the level of precision?
  * Q: Is it your responsibility as members of the same team to “trust but verify” or should you trust peers 100% to work honestly?
  * Q: How might you handle a situation where someone is not clearly falsifying, fabricating, or plagiarizing but something just feels unethical? Is there a chain of command in your company to report this situation? How does your industry think of / treat whistleblowers?
    * What would you do if you talk to a trusted colleague and they tell you to just keep quiet?
    * Are you more willing to raise concerns about someone in your company when your fates are not linked vs when they are?
  * Q: Is there an institutional review board in your company? Is there anyone who determines/assesses what you can do to your subject or customers? Or do you simply say, “well they agreed to the terms and conditions and so anything goes”?
  * Q: “How should consent provisions be modified for children, prisoners, and mentally ill, the undereducated, or other vulnerable populations?” (p.25)
  * Q: What’s the equivalent of “lab safety” in data science? What level of emotional and psychological risk should we expose people do?
  * Q: Are their any ethical concerns of unknowingly subjecting customers to experiments or manipulation?
  * Q: What’s the process for review of white papers in your org? Is it too easy to disseminate findings? (e.g. p. 32 “...research results bypass traditional quality mechanisms.”)


Discussion Questions:
* Consider the emergence of data science and think of its impact on a field or industry that you are in or would like to be involved in. 
* Consider Kuhn’s framework of analysis and the specific components of his account of science.  Discuss how that field or industry does and does not conform to Kuhn’s typology. Explain and analyze how that field is in transition/transformation as a result of data science. Does it support Kuhn’s ideas of scientific change? Is it a “revolution” in Kuhn’s terms?  How useful do you find the idea of “revolution”?
* Be prepared to share and discuss your thoughts in class. Use the discussion section of your portfolio to write your notes.
