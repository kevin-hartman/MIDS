* If you would like an overview of some design fundamentals, we recommend Edward Tufte, Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Publisher: Graphics Press; 2nd edition (May 2001), ISBN 978-0961392147 [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/B0084IP4DS). You may find the following sections most useful. Ch. 1: pp. 13, 51; Ch. 2: pp. 53, 76-7. Ch; 3, 5, 6, 9.


Additional video:
* Below you can find a short youtube video that will supplement my overview at the beginning of class. You must be signed into your bmail account to view the video.

Additional takeaways:
* Below are some questions to help you digest the material
  * Think about when you present information to a client or decision maker. When you choose a visualization for your data, how do you decide whether to make the visuals static or dynamic? 
    * How might the nature off the finding you want to convey determine whether or not the visualization is interactive and dynamic?
  * How do you determine the right level of simplification in a persuasive presentation or a visualization? How do you balance simplification with accuracy when presenting complex situations? How do you determine what goes into the appendix and what goes into the main presentation?
  * What ethical considerations should we keep in mind when we construct ways to visualize and communicate our findings?
  * Broad question from Edward Tufte, Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Graphics Press; 2nd edition (May 2001), (not required reading)
    * “The interior decorations of graphics generates a lot of ink that does not tell the viewer anything new” 
    * “…all non-data-ink or redundant data-ink…often called chartjunk.” (Ch 5, p. 107)
    * How might Tufte's rules for best practices & chart junk apply in today's world of highly interactive visual displays? (e.g. are mouseovers "chart junk"?)
    * How do we find the middle ground between getting rid of chart junk and providing some additional information to help the audience?


Discussion Questions:
* Find two publicly available data visualizations: one that you find distinctly powerful and one that is weak or distracting. What makes them effective and poorly executed? 
* Consider whether Kanflic’s notions of decluttering help explain your judgment of what is good or bad (they may not) (e.g. chapter 3). If you have your own quality criteria, name and explain them (e.g. interactive visualizations).
* Be prepared to share and discuss your thoughts in class. Use the discussion section of your portfolio to write your notes. Be prepared to have these images readily available either as a URL or a PDF file, as you may share them during the live sessions.
