# Programming projects

This course includes 3 guided programming projects. They will distributed at the beginning of the course and should be submitted (via github) by the beginning of your live session in the week specified below. They will involve filling in relatively short pieces of code in a python notebook and sometimes brief analysis of results.

Late submissions will be accepted up to 1 week past the deadline with a 10% penalty, but you need to let your instructor know if you’ll be submitting late.

You may work alone or in groups but you need to write your own code. Discussion, especially about programming issues, on the wall is encouraged.

* Project 1 Due: Week 5
* Project 2 Due: Week 9
* Project 3 Due: Week 13

# Final project
At the midway point in the course, your instructor will share details about the final project. You’ll choose from a list of relevant Kaggle competitions, run experiments, write up a notebook summarizing your work and key results, and give a short presentation in the final live session. You are strongly encouraged to work in groups.

* Baseline submission: Week 10
* Check-in with instructor: Week 12
* Notebook due and in-class presentation: Week 14

# Grading
Final grades will be based on
* 3 Projects: 60%
* Final project: 35%
* Participation: 5%

# Programming environment
All the projects should run fine on your personal computer. Install python, ipython notebook, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. A number of other useful packages will be introduced during the semester.

Both Enthought and Anaconda are free python distributions that include all the relevant packages.
