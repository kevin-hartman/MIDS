Discussion Topics for [An Excercise in Operationalization](./patent_reading.pdf)
* Terms
  * Operationalize - a process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon that is not directly measurable, though its existence is inferred by other phenomena.
  * Conceptual Definition - A definition in terms of concepts, such as the one found in a dictionary, instead of in terms of the results of measuring procedures.
  * Operational Definition - A showing of something — such as a variable, term, or object — in terms of the specific process or set of validation tests used to determine its presence and quantity.
  * Face Validity - the extent to which a test is subjectively viewed as covering the concept it purports to measure. A test can be said to have face validity if it "looks like" it is going to measure what it is supposed to measure.
  * Construct Validity - the degree to which a test measures what it claims, or purports, to be measuring; whether the test measures the the intended construct.
* Schoenmakers and Duysters are particularly interested in radical inventions. Explain what their conceptual definition is and how it is related to their operational definition.
  * Conceptual definition - The characterization of inventions are one of two types: Incremental or Radical. The classification method they're using to determine Incremental vs Radical is that Radical inventions exhibit key characteristics that are inherently different from existing products or technologies. They often lie at the heart of changes in technological paradigms (Nelson and Winter, 1982), thereby creating new technological systems and sometimes even new industries. Radical inventions break with common knowledge and form a new field. Incremental inventions provide additive benefits within a current field.
  * Operational definition - They are operationalizing by infering how many times a patent for an invention is referenced by other patents, implying patents that cite other patents can be classified as new inventions inspired by prior inventions. When the count is sufficiently large, the prior invention can be classified as a radical invention. The cutoff is 20.
* In your opinion, does the author’s operational definition of radical invention have validity? (does it have face validity? construct validity?)
  * The operational definition has face validity but not construct validity. The measurement of patent citations may be a valid measurement, but it may measure a different construct. On the surface, however, it might be a plausable test, but to be deemed valid the test needs to be confirmed against a verifiable sample. This could be one of several vectors that can satisfy the definition test.
* If you believe there is a discrepancy between the author’s operational definition of radical invention and the intended concept, how could this affect their conclusions? What factors, other than whether an invention is radical, could be driving their results?
  * They may be concluding something else entirely. The invention may not be radical, but rather, a set of patents may just be  popular, or easier to reference than others. We're mixing paradigms and implying causality. Maybe not all radical inventions have patents?
* In what other ways could you operationalize the concept of radical invention?
  * What is the impact from the invention on everyday life? Can we measure productivity gained in a certain segment before and after the invention? Number of failed night-time operations by physicians before the invention of the light bulb vs after.

Additional Live Session Notes
* In the sofware industry you don't file patents to protect IP, you file them so you can have a portfolio for cross suits
* Triple damages can be assessed if you do a patent search
* They never tied the arguments
* Face validity - subjective idea of whether this makes sense
* Content validity - measure of the power you have to make your measurement - do you have enough data. Do you have enough levers?
* Construct validity - operationalization - is it effective. Can you get at what you're saying your getting at. Do you actually measure the radicalness of the invention by measuring citations. Does the construct work. Is it doing what its saying its doing.
* Look at the number of citations made by that patent and number of citations that patent made
