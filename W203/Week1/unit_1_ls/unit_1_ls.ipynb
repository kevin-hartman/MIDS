    "   1. Before live session: Watch all async content.  Complete all required readings.\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   2. In live session: We will build upon the async to test and extend your understanding\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   3. After live session: complete the homework for the unit (due before next live session)\n",

    "- [Course Webpage](https://w203-summer-19.github.io/)\n",
    "    - Look here for the most up-to-date course policies.  There is a useful calendar that shows you what work should be done each week.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- [ISVC](https://learn.datascience.berkeley.edu/login)\n",
    "    - This is the platform with course videos.  You will also submit your homework here.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - Unfortunately, we're in an iteration freeze that means that some information on the ISVC is out-of-date.  Please look to the course webpage for the correct list of deliverables, videos, and grading policies.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "- [Github Org: w203-summer-19](https://github.com/w203-summer-19)\n",
    "    - We will distribute homework, labs, and live session documents through Github.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    - You should have received an invite to our github org to your ischool email address, it will allow you to join with any github account you like.\n",

If you are not familiar with Github, don't worry about the details right now.  Find the green button to download a zip file containing all documents to your machine.

    "\n",
    "Here are some strategies we think will help.\n",

    "   1. Get to know your readings, especially the Devore and Wooldridge textbooks.  (We may occasionally ask questions that you can only answer if you keep up with the readings)\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   2. Do the best job on the homework you can.\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   3. Strategize about the homework exercises with friends as much as you want, but write the final proofs and final scripts by yourself.  (However, note that you are not allowed to discusses quizzes or labs with anyone else unless otherwise specified)\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   4. Try each problem on your own for at least a little bit.  \n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   5. If you're stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, talk to a classmate, come to office hours, or ask a question on piazza.\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   6. Form study groups!\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   7. Come to office hours!  Many office hours!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Discussion Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Take 5 minutes to discuss these in breakouts, before our class-wide discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Why do you need to know classical statistics, when we have fancy machine learning algorithms that can classify and predict with amazing accuracy?\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   2. Why isn't descriptive statistics enough for your career?\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   3. What mistake might result from confusing a sample mean for a population mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from today I will use a jupyter notebook with an R kernel to instruct you. You can read a little more about this technology [here](https://plot.ly/python/ipython-vs-python/).  You will need to install applications and packages in order to use these notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every system is different and in the life of a data scientist figuring out how to get and install useful software packages from tutorial and question/answers on the internet is an extremely valuable skill.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please do this by next week. \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible way to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Install R from CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   2. Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   3. Update conda using conda: \"conda update conda\"\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   4. Install R-essentials package using conda: \"conda install -c r r-essentials\" \n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   5. Install any other packages from CRAN or from Anaconda Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "R studio is another platform that is even more popular among R coders (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ or in Anaconda).  It is fantastic for coding, but less adapted to teaching.  You may find it useful for completing some assignments, especially the later labs.\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "### 12. Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "Before next week:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Install Jupyter with an R kernel.\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   2. Complete the Unit 1 homework located in our Github org (due 24 hours before next live session).\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   3. Watch all unit 3 async content (plus the short videos 2.4 and 2.5)\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "   4. Do the reading for week 2 (Devore chapter 2 and the <a href=https://w203-summer-19.github.io/patent_reading.pdf > patent handout </a>)"
